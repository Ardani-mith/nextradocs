# Final Steps

## Populate your database

The project uses Prisma for the schema, and you can automatically populate your database with the necessary structure.

Run the following command to populate your database:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run prisma db push
```

## Start the local server

In order to verify if everything is working properly and to further customize the project to your own SaaS, you need to start a local development server. You can do so using any of the following commands:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

The command before should output something like this:

```bash
  ▲ Next.js 14.2.3
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Environments: .env.local

  ✓ Starting...
  ✓ Ready in 2.4s
```

If this is the case, you can just **CTRL** + **Click** on http://localhost:3000, or manually opening it on your browser.

## That's it!

Congratulations on successfully seting up the basics to run the project locally.

You can now edit and start making changes to the project and begin your SaaS journey.
