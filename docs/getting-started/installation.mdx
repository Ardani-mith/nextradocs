Alternatively, you can also clone it using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) application.

## Install the dependencies

This starter kit currently uses NPM as the package manager. If you prefer to use a different one, delete the `package-lock.json` before.

To install the dependencies, do as follows:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install
```
